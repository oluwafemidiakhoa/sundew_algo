ðŸ“Š Results Guide â€” Sundew Algorithm Experiments

This folder contains experiment outputs from single-run and multi-run grid searches using different config presets.

1. Single-Run Visualizations

Generated by:

python benchmarks/plot_single_run.py --preset tuned_v2 --events 400 --out results/plots_tuned --savecsv results/runs_tuned/single_run_tuned_v2.csv

Plots

Threshold & EMA over time (single_run_threshold_ema_*.png)

Solid line: adaptive threshold value per event.

Dashed line: EMA (exponentially smoothed) activation rate.

Goal: EMA tracks the target activation rate; threshold rises/falls as control feedback.

Energy over time (single_run_energy_*.png)

Y-axis: remaining energy budget.

Sharp drops: deep processing activations.

Sawtooth recharge pattern: dormancy regeneration cycles.

Activation spikes (single_run_activations_*.png)

Stem plot: binary 0/1 activations per event.

Density of spikes â‰ˆ achieved activation rate.

Each row = one event:

1,0.70,95.2,0.00,0, tuned_v2,42
2,0.71,93.5,0.02,1, tuned_v2,42

2. Multi-Run Grid Search

Generated by:

python benchmarks/grid_search.py --events 300 --repeats 3 --out results/grid.csv --logdir results/runs
python benchmarks/plot_grid.py --csv results/grid.csv --out results/plots

Plots

Distribution of Final Thresholds

Histogram of thresholds across runs.

Shows where adaptation stabilized.

Energy Savings vs. Temperature

X-axis: gating temperature.

Y-axis: % energy saved compared to non-selective baseline.

Steeper drop = less efficiency at higher stochasticity.

Activation vs. Target (by temperature)

Diagonal = perfect tracking.

Points below diagonal = under-activating.

Useful for tuning adapt_kp, adapt_ki, and error_deadband.

3. How to Tune
Symptom	Likely Fix
EMA lags far below target	â†‘ adapt_kp or adapt_ki
Threshold clamps to max too quickly	â†“ energy_pressure
Energy drains too fast	â†‘ max_energy or â†‘ dormancy_regen
Too many activations early	â†‘ min_threshold or â†‘ error_deadband
4. Presets

Defined in src/sundew/config_presets.py:

baseline â€” defaults, reference behavior.

tuned_v1 / tuned_v2 â€” experimental refinements.

aggressive â€” lower thresholds, more frequent activations.

energy_saver â€” stricter thresholds, maximized savings.
